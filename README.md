# FluexGL API documentation
FluexGL is a toolkit for building advanced, WebGPU-powered graphics on the web.

## About FluexGL
WebGPU is the new standard for web graphics and unlocks features like ray tracing and GPU compute. FluexGL wraps these capabilities so you can focus on your app instead of low-level boilerplate.

FluexGL handles the heavy lifting under the hood: geometries and shaders, perspective and matrix math, user input, networking, and more.

## Why it exists
FluexGL is built to create beautiful graphics and games with tools developers already know. It stays lightweight and fast to load, and embraces WebGPU while many libraries are still tied to the older WebGL.

## Cross platform
WebGPU is available in modern browsers on Windows, macOS, and Linux. FluexGL also runs inside Electron, giving games a desktop feel.

## Advanced audio processing
FluexGL includes a subproject called FluexGL DSP, focused on advanced audio with the WebAudio API, WebAssembly, and more.
